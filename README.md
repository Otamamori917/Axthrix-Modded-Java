## Factions

### Axthraxians Or The Axthrix
they are focused on technological advancement 
they don't necessarily want to kill the Ikatusa but study them instead 
The main faction of the mod aka the one that will be played as in campaign.

### Raodonians Or The Raodon
They plan on leading the Ikatusa to Extinction, so they can harvest Oganesson From Tharaxia the only know planet to generate it
They Deal with their plan swiftly and forcefully nothing will stand in their way. *(except axthrix)*

### Ikatusicans Or the Ikatusa
Dwell on the planet Tharaxia 
As the wildlife on the planet you can expect what they would act like.
